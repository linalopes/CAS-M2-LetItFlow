    "# Normalization:\n",
    "Normalizing the audio samples to a uniform length of 18 seconds, by cropping longer files and padding shorter ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency**: Having all audio files with the same length makes it easier for algorithms to process and compare them. It avoids issues where models need to handle variable-length inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alignment**: When performing operations like feature extraction (e.g., frequency analysis, zero-crossing rate), it's beneficial for the features to be extracted from audio clips of the same duration, ensuring that features like spectral centroid and dominant frequency are based on consistent timeframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding Shorter Files**: Padding shorter files to a fixed length ensures that you don't lose important information from shorter clips. The padding (often with zeros) won't affect the meaningful parts of the signal but will give you a consistent length.\n"
